### appendrange.go

Write a function that takes an `int min` and an `int max` as parameters. The function should return a slice of ints with all the values between the `min` and `max`.

- Min is included, and max is excluded.

- If `min` is greater than or equal to `max`, a `nil` slice is returned.

`make` is not allowed for this exercise.
